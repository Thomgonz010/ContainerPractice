Documentation

-installed the packages required for these container set ups as noted in the source.
-just incase I need this
Key ID (6D33866EDD8FFA41C0143AEDDCC9EFBF77E11517) in hex I am believe
-I set up the "helloworld" OS tree as shown in the article and received
"Base system installed successfully" in the shell
-used chown and chmod command to force root to have permissions to the directory
-I used cd /var/lib/machines/helloworld to access the directory then used the systemd-nspawn -b
command to launch the container
-I may not have set up a user/pw combo for the container, so I launched another container and used
ps -ef and then kill <container id> to kill the process.
-I did the echo requests and started up the network process for container helloworld.
-I need a refresher on document creation using the BASH and making scripts to automate container
launches and networks. I will start this 9/10

Notes to me:
- access container directory by /var/lib/machines/helloworld
- cd into it
